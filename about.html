              I am in my school HLS For the students of the family, respected
              parents, principal and hardworking teachers and all the dedicated
              staff, I want to give a message with this couplet -
              <br />
              "Draw in the sky, such a grand streak. Just by asking you, God
              will write the fate. "
              <br />
              This is the inspiration, this message, this duty, the school has
              been giving to the students since its inception in the year 2000.
              It has been the excellent wish and expectation of me and the
              school family that our dear students, while living here and going
              out successfully, touch new heights and achieve their new heights
              of success. Create history.With discipline, dedication, goodwill,
              tireless hard work, high quality in education and personality
              building, the school creates and builds at every step from primary
              to intermediate. High school, laying the foundation of life in
              primary and junior high school, Strong walls are made in the
              middle on which our students can build the grand buildings of
              their life.To keep the standard of education very high, there is a
              highly qualified dedicated academic staff whose reputation lives
              far and wide every day from coming to school every day. Till the
              evening and even after that, students take education by staying in
              a proper arrangement at the time of the hostel. "Discipline,
              conscientiousness, high quality education with values" is the
              basic mantra of H.L.S. "U. P . Special attention is paid to
              computer education (theory and practical), English speaking
              classes, online, cultural programs with career guidance, speaker
              writing, general knowledge, sports, talent development along with
              the board's curriculum. <br />
              Routine in the hostel begins with routine tasks after the warden
              wakes up the students at 4 in the morning. PT After morning study
              and morning group bath, classes from 7 to 8 am after meal and then
              after breakfast at 4 pm after school holidays and after sports,
              entertainment (TV and projects available) dinner from 7 to 8 pm
              After studying and night with milk or tea (night rest after 10.30
              pm), some teachers including the principal, vice principal,
              in-charge of arrangements run the hostel by staying as warden.
              Students themselves clean their clothes and plates, which
              inculcates self-reliance and values ​​in them. There is a huge
              campus and natural village where I became PCS (Deputy Collector)
              in the first attempt in 1977-78. I have only one expectation from
              my students that they should give Guru Dakshina by becoming PCS,
              IAS, or show achievement by achieving in any field. Your manager
